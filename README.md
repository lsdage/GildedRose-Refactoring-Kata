# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This is my fork of Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata.

The Kata was originally created by [Terry Hughes](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) for C#.

This fork comes from [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache) and her many translations of the original version.
For more information on the Kata, visit the [original repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).
